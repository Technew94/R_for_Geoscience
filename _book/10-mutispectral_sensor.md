# Multispectral sensors

In this section I'll introduce you to three well-known high-resolution multispectral sensor satellites in this section: [MODIS](https://modis.gsfc.nasa.gov/), [Landsat](https://landsat.gsfc.nasa.gov/), and [Sentinel-2](https://www.esa.int/Applications/Observing_the_Earth/Copernicus/Sentinel-2).
